## General Information
From a Lending Club loan dataset, we extracted  general information such as the average loan amount, interest rates, and credit scores of borrowers. 
Additionally, analyzed business-related insights, like the distribution of loan purposes or the default rates for different loan categories, to draw pattern on what ground 
future loan can be released.
